			Art Examples<br/>
			Some examples of art that I've developed using an evolving generator program and rendering engine: <a href="images/spheres1.jpg">1</a> <a href="images/boxtest45.jpg">2</a> <a href="images/shiny-pod27.jpg">3</a> <a href="images/boxer.jpg">4</a>. I also created <a href="images/quaternionPlayLarge.jpg">this</a> work, which was generated by hand.<br/>

			Speech Recognition Videos, Graphics Videos, Hardware and Art Videos<br/>
			Many videos are available through <a href="https://vimeo.com/codehearted">my Vimeo account</a> documenting projects such as <a href="https://vimeo.com/269885655">Mathy</a>, a completely speech-operated iPad App built to help solve a series of math problems by asking it as you would a person. There are two videos of two separate speech recognition engine examples tuned to different language models, <a href="https://vimeo.com/269893268">one using the Declaration of Independence</a>, and <a href="https://vimeo.com/269893201">one using Romeo and Juliet</a>, with each being read the same set of lines, showing how what one has heard in the past affects what one hears in the present.<br/>
			There are graphics demos such as the kaledoscopic <a href="https://vimeo.com/269891161">Spiraling Shape</a>, which uses camera input to change the input to the shader, and <a href="https://vimeo.com/269892934">Dragonfly Wings</a>, another GPU shader based fractal animation. I also have a video of an interactive <a href="https://vimeo.com/269891351">Newton Fractal Explorer</a>.
			There are also many videos documenting my Masters project, <a href="https://vimeo.com/167803047">Forces of Nature</a>, which uses a grid of electromagnets to manipulate a vessel of ferrofluid under computer control through an iOS based UI used by a human performer. <a href="https://vimeo.com/167800224">A much longer demo</a> including a view of the user interface on iOS, showing which electromagnets are active at which times. There are also two <a href="https://vimeo.com/181072660">public</a> <a href="https://vimeo.com/181074929">performance</a> videos. <a href="https://vimeo.com/169163914">Experiments with a different type of ferrofluid vessel</a> have also proven interesting.<br/>

			Interactive SVG Data Visualization Charts<br/>
			I designed and programmed a generation system to visualize a large, multi-dimensional dataset and a set of filters that categorize the data. <a href="images/PlotOfCaliforniaQuailMainOhioCall-CHECK_ELIST_DUR.svg">The SVG chart example</a> includes interactive zoom and horizontal panning capabilities, and shows multiple filters and the dataset in an intuitive way.<br/>

		<a href="cml_plans/index.html">Cerritos Millenium Library Overview</a> <br/>
		A set of technical infrastructure plans for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerritos_Millennium_Library">Cerritos Millenium Library</a>, used for internal design, planning, and presentation purposes.<br/>

		<a href="images/Contractor_Scope.png">Contractor</a><br/>
		A screenshot from Contractor, a Macintosh application I designed to make it easier to write consulting contracts. I have <a href="images/Contractor_Scope2.png">another shot</a> of the same page in use context, with the user choosing how to refer to the client in the generated contract. <br/>

		<a href="./windowTest.html">Un-named Javascript Window Mangaer</a><br/>
		A prototype of an AJAX window manager I worked on for the codehearted site, it is built as a layer on top of <a href="http://dynapi.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">dynAPI</a>. My code here supports click-dragging of windows, close-box functionality, and clicking to bring a window to front (layering). Note that this code was written in 2002, the current version of Safari and Chrome show some cosmetic issues while dragging, and the close boxes no longer function in 2018 browsers. But overall, for a 16 year old web tech demo, it functions pretty well.
