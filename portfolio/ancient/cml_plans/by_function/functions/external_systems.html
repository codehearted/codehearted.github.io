Access to these critical library databases is expected to be limited to read-only.</p>			<p>The system will also recieve environmental information from the SmartBuilding system, and integrate it into the Cliolink environment as is deemed appropriate. For example, the graphical layout of the library that a user sees while browsing through library areas in the tour may indicate the ambient room temperature on the area map.</p>			<p>Cliolink will connect to several external content databases on the behalf of users, caching results system-wide where possible to lower external network bandwith usage.</p>		</blockquote>		<p></p>		<div align="right">			<p></p>			<p><font size="+2"><i><a href="../index.html"  title="Function Index">Function Index</a></i></font></p>		</div>	</body></html>
