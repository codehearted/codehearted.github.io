Even anonymous users will be granted access through a temporary library card purchased from a vending machine or borrowed from the circulation desk. Each account is allocated a small amount of storage, perhaps 25MB, and can store information such as favorite subjects, billing information, websites to track for changes, and other details. Personal storage space may also be used for documents, images, downloaded media, or other digital resources. Patrons can also access account information such as their own currently checked out or reserved books, without the assistance of a librarian.</p>			<p>Library patrons may access digital as well as physical materials with a special, personalized interface to the Cliolink 2001 Intranet, similar to those used on the web today - such as MyYahoo, MyEbay, and so on. Special research tools, including a metadata search service, will be researched and developed as time permits, once critical library services are operational.</p>			<p>A patron may search for physical materials tracked by the Bestseller system, access the internet, or catch up on library news and upcoming events. Internet and CD-ROM&nbsp;based&nbsp;databases&nbsp;are also accessable at public workstations. Live technical or research assistance will be available through the system as well - via networked communication with library staff members.</p>			<p>Part of the patron support structure is the web-accessable side of Cliolink, Clioweb. This will provide authenticated and encrypted access to library indexes, materials, and general information. During business hours, users logged into Clioweb may view low-resolution video streams normally only available (though at much higher quality) from public machines inside the library.</p>			<p></p>		</blockquote>		<div align="right">			<p></p>			<p><font size="+2"><i><a href="../index.html" title="Function Index">Function Index</a></i></font></p>		</div>	</body></html>
