While the exact requiremeAuthentication of users will be required before access to sensitive network resources will be granted.</p>   <p>Cliolink 2001 will be developed in a modular fashion - pieces will be entirely self-contained with minimal dependence on the external interfaces of other components, and zero dependence on the internal structure of other components. This will streamline development and maintenance, as well as simplify the system as a whole. Functional modules will be cleanly seperated from interface modules, so that, for example, the code to retrieve a search result from a database would not have to be written twice if the results are to be displayed both through a web interface and through a telephone-based spoken interface.</p>   <p></p>   <h3>Low-Level Cliolink Components</h3>   <ul>    <li>Basic Boot and Network Services - Network Access, Network Configuration/DHCP, etc..    <li>Network Shared / Secondary Storage    <li>Network Printing Services    <li>Remote Machine Administration / Configuration    <li>Central User Authentication Services - Based on magstripe card, smartcard, of whichever choice makes the most sense.    <li>Proactive <a href="security.html" target="_parent">Network Security</a> Monitoring / Notification - Will watch out for suspicious or unusual network traffic, and notify technical staff when a break-in is suspected, as well as record the observed traffic for forensic inspection and future security system fortification.    <li>Streaming Media (Live / Stored) Services    <li>External Data Services Interface - Interfaces with external systems such as Checkpoint, Bestseller, and Epscohost.   </ul>   <p></p>   <h3>Mid-Level Cliolink Components</h3>   <ul>    <li>Cliolink Interface Abstraction API - allows services below this layer to be accessed in a uniform manner by services above this layer.    <li>API Protocol Field Verification Engine (independent of higher or lower level protocol, using the abstraction layer). This prevents accidentally or maliciously malformed data from corrupting the system, as well as ensuring that all request parameters are of the right type and within a specific acceptable range of values.    <li>Many Low-Level Components (such as printing services and networked storage) may be accessed directly by higher level layers.   </ul>   <p></p>   <p></p>   <h3>High-Level Cliolink Components</h3>   <ul>    <li>Handheld Interface    <li>Public Web Interface    <li>Public Interface    <li>Staff Interface    <li>MyCliolink   </ul>   <blockquote>    <ul>     <li>Like <a href="http://my.yahoo.com" target="_blank" title="CML Examples &gt;&gt; My Yahoo">MyYahoo</a> for the simple customizations.     <li>Could provide bindings and example source for popular languages (like javascript and perl) for patrons.     <li>Custom interface design application could be developed to guide patrons through creating a limited custom interface. (an extension of the MyYahoo concept)    </ul>   </blockquote>   <p></p>  </blockquote>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <div align="right">   <p></p>   <p><font size="+2"><i><a href="../index.html" title="Function Index">Function Index</a></i></font></p>  </div>  <p></p> </body></html>
